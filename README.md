# @tavily/n8n-nodes-tavily

@tavily/n8n-nodes-tavily is a node for n8n that integrates the Tavily API, enabling powerful web search and content extraction within your no-code automation workflows.

## Features

### Tavily Search
Tavily Search allows you to query the web with powerful filtering capabilities, including options to refine results by topic, time range, and specific domains to include or exclude. You can choose to retrieve a generated answer, raw content, or even related images, depending on your workflow needs. It also supports different search depths—basic or advanced. 

### Tavily Extract
 Tavily Extract allows you to effortlessly retrieve raw content from a list of websites, making it ideal for data collection, content analysis, and research. You can also combine Tavily Extract with our Search method: first, obtain a list of relevant documents, then perform further processing on selected links to gather additional information and use it as context for your research tasks.

### Tavily Crawl
Tavily Crawl allows you to intelligently crawl a website from a starting URL to discover and extract content across multiple pages. Control depth, breadth, and apply filters to tailor your crawl for comprehensive analysis and content aggregation.
